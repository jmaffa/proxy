# Proxy
Used Spark Java to mock a proxy API. End users can parse and search CSV files through the proxy API. Additionally, they can query the National Weather Service API and receive relevant temperature data for a given coordinate location. 

Developed this project for Brown University's CSCI0320: Software Engineering. Code is not displayed to keep the solution private, but it is available upon request.
