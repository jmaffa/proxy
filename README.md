# REPL Proxy
Built a frontend REPL interface with React and TypeScript where users can query to a Spark Java proxy API. End users can parse and search CSV files through the proxy API. Additionally, they can query the National Weather Service API and receive relevant temperature data for a given coordinate location. 

Developed this project for Brown University's CSCI0320: Software Engineering. Code is not displayed to keep the solution private, but it is available upon request.
